Hello! My name is Bharavi Misra, and I am a third year undergraduate [Schreyer](https://www.shc.psu.edu/) honors scholar at Penn State University studying Computer Engineering. I have previously worked at [Siemens Digital Industries Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) as a SWE intern and the [Materials Research Institute](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) at Penn State as an undergraduate fellow. 

At Penn State, I am involved with the [College of Engineering's Engineering Ambassadors](https://www.leonhardcenter.psu.edu/engineering-ambassadors/index.aspx) program, [HackPSU](https://hackpsu.org/), and am pursuing an undergraduate thesis under [Professor Jinghui Chen](https://jinghuichen.github.io/)'s supervision.

I am interested in deep learning, computer vision, and boosting my coding skills in general! This site serves as a place for me to showcase my journey as a budding software engineer and ML enthusiast.
