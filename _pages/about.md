Hello! My name is Bharavi Misra, and I am a recent graduate of Penn State University with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. I have previously worked at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) as a SWE intern, [Siemens Digital Industries Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) as a SWE intern, and the [Materials Research Institute](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) at Penn State as an undergraduate fellow. 

At Penn State, I was involved with the [Advanced Vehicle Team](https://www.avt.psu.edu/), the [College of Engineering's Engineering Ambassadors](https://www.leonhardcenter.psu.edu/engineering-ambassadors/index.aspx) program, [HackPSU](https://hackpsu.org/), and completed an undergraduate thesis under [Professor Jinghui Chen's](https://jinghuichen.github.io/) supervision.

I am interested in deep learning, software engineering, and boosting my coding skills in general! This site serves as a place for me to showcase my journey as a software engineer.
